# Adapting SSL settings (second VirtualHost) from /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl 
# in apache2 as installed in ubuntu 12.04.
#
# We support both HTTP and HTTPS, with two separate files in sites-available.
# This file holds only the settings unique to the HTTPS VirtualHost, with all
# shared configuration included from 'opentree-shared.conf'. See
# http://serverfault.com/questions/83669/apache2-with-ssl-do-i-have-to-copy-virtualhost-blocks
#
# This file should be periodically reviewed as apache versions advance and
#  'best practice' for virtual host configurations changes.
